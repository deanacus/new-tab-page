# Start Page

A simple javascript application to provide a more useful start page and new tab
page for yourbrowser.

It's built with [React][react] and is pretty much just an excuse to start
digging a little deeper into React and learn a few intermediate concepts such as
conditional rendering and the like.

## Install

Clone the repo, then cd into the directory. Then, just install and away you go:

```
npm install
```

To get a local version servedin your browser, simply run:

```
npm run dev
```

and it will load up in your browser.

Happy hacking.

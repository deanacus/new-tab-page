# Upstart styles

This is a very basic styling library that forms a part of my Upstart project boiler plate.

It's broken out into it's own repo, with the intent that it be included in other repos using git submodules.

For this reason, there is nothing but the raw SCSS files, as the intent is that you already have a build process, you just need to include this as a submodule whereever your existing build process is expecting styles, and it should just work.
